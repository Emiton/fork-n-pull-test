My name is Brittney and I'm 28. I came into the CareerDevs program with very little knowledge about programming, but I intend to leave a full stack developer. 
I'm hoping this program will give me the tools necessary to be a great programmer, and make a lucrative living. I'm still at the point where I need to do lots 
of Googling, I certainly can't wait until I actually feel like I know what I'm doing.
